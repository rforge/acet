\title{
The ACE(t)-p model 
}
\description{
The ACE(t)-p model with the A and C variance components as functions with respect to age modelled by P-splines.
}
\usage{
AtCtEp(data_m, data_d, knot_a = 8, knot_c = 8, eps = 0.1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data_m}{
An \eqn{N_m} x 3 data matrix for MZ twins. \eqn{N_m} is the number of MZ twin pairs. The first two columns are traits and the third column is age (or other covariates). 

}
  \item{data_d}{
An \eqn{N_d} x 3 data matrix for DZ twins. \eqn{N_d} is the number of DZ twin pairs. The first two columns are traits and the third column is age (or other covariates). 
}
  \item{knot_a}{
The number of knots of the B-spline for the A component. The default value is 5.
}
  \item{knot_c}{
The number of knots of the B-spline for the C component. The default value is 5.
}
  \item{eps}{
Tolerance for convergence of the EM algorithm iterations. The default value is 0.1.
